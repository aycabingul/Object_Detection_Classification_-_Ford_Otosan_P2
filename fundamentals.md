# Fundamentals
In this section, brief information about semantic segmentation and object recognition is given.
Image Classification helps us to classify what is contained in an image. Image Localization will specify the location of single object in an image whereas Object Detection specifies the location of multiple objects in the image. Finally, Image Segmentation will create a pixel wise mask of each object in the images.
